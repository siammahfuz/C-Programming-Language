C-Programming-Language
Welcome to the C Programming Language repository!

C is one of the most fundamental and widely-used programming languages, especially for systems programming, embedded systems, and low-level software development. This repository is dedicated to helping beginners understand the core concepts of C through simple, clear, and practical examples.

ðŸ“Œ About This Repository
This project is designed as an introductory guide to the C programming language. I've written and organized C programs using my own techniques and learning approaches, aiming to make them easy to follow and beginner-friendly.

Whether you're a student just getting started with programming or someone revisiting C for a refresher, this repository will provide a hands-on learning experience.

ðŸ§  What You'll Learn
Basics of C syntax and structure

Input/Output operations

Conditional statements and loops

Functions and scope

Arrays and strings

Pointers and memory management

File handling

Basic data structures (optional/coming soon)
